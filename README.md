## Examples

### Installed device

![Instance](./imgs/instance.png)

This is the example of how succesfully installed Crafty integration should look like (there can be some differences in the number of devices/entities based on your *Crafty Controller* installation)

### All devices

![All devices](./imgs/devices.png)
At all time there will be at least 3 devices (All Roles, All Servers and All Users) and based on your Crafty installation there will be added another devices for each of them to provide nice UI.

### All roles

![All roles](./imgs/all_roles.png)

The Roles sensor will show the number of roles based on your specific settings and it will have connected the respective number of devices (roles) which will each have their own sensors

#### Examples for _testing role 1_
![Example role](./imgs/example_role.png)

##### Example of _Server access_
![Example role server access](./imgs/example_role_server_access.png)

Here you can see the number of servers **Role** has access to and the list of permissions for each server in sensor attributes.

##### Example of _Users_
![Example role users](./imgs/example_role_users.png)

This sensor shows the number of **Users** asigned to this role with list of users in its attributes.

### All users

![All users](./imgs/all_users.png)

The Users sensor will show the number of users your Crafty installation has (at least 1 should be there because you need the admin to log-in into the API)

#### Example for _admin_

![Example user](./imgs/example_user.png)

##### Example of _Roles_

![Example user roles](./imgs/example_user_roles.png)

In this part the integration will provide you with ability to see the number of roles the **User** has been assigned to and in attributes you can see the list of their names.

### All servers

![All Servers](./imgs/all_servers.png)

Here you are able to se 2 sensors:

1. **Servers Offline**: This will show the number of servers that are offline
2. **Servers Online**: This will obviously show the number of online servers

and next you can see that there are mentioned the servers that you have running (added) in Crafty Controller.

#### Example for _Majnr+_

![Example server](./imgs/example_server.png)

Here you can at the first glance see that there is some controlls, with these you are able to control the respective server based on the button name. Next you can see multiple statistics of the selected server.
